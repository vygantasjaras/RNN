In this assignment I was able to identify Intel Corporation (INTC) and obtain stock price history for a 10 years.
In this task I had to use the stock price history and predict the stock prices for the month of August 2019, and compare them against the actual stock prices for August 2019.
First, I optimized and expiremented my findings. Then, I wrote comments in my notebook about every step, explaining it in detail and provided a stock prices Graph.
